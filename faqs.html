                    Theatrical cinemas book films with their UK distributors. Most film bookings for theatrical cinemas
                    are agreed over email (see our List of distributors for contact details). These booking agreements
                    constitute film copyright licensing.

                    Once a film is booked in, the distributor will supply your cinema with any available marketing
                    materials and a screening copy of the film.

                    If you’re starting a new cinema, bear in mind that most theatrical distributors require you to open
                    an account with them and may ask for a deposit. You’ll need to register with distributors at least
                    three to four months in advance of your cinema opening so they can process your application in time
                    to confirm your bookings.

                    <span class="question">3.I’m an independent filmmaker and I would like to do an interview with
                        Cinemax.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Absolutely! We love doing interviews with independent filmmakers; thus far, it has always been a
                    pleasant experience for both parties. We feel that promotion of smaller, lesser-known films and
                    filmmakers is one of the most important charges of bloggers and critics around the world. If you
                    have a short film, a feature or something

                    <span class="question">4.How do I find out when a film is being released?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The easiest way is to go to the Film Distributor’s Association (FDA) website’s UK Film Release
                    Schedule which lists films slated for release in the coming months and years (and those released in
                    months and years prior).

                    The schedule is frequently updated, and it’s not uncommon for release dates to change.

                    Release dates are also listed in individual film records on the BBFC’s website and on IMDb (by
                    country).
